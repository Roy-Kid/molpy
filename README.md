> **⚠️ MolPy is under active development.**
> The API is evolving rapidly and may change between minor versions.

**MolPy** is a modern, strongly typed, and extensible toolkit for molecular modeling.
It provides a clean data model, flexible builders, explicit force-field typing, and lightweight analysis — a foundation designed for reproducible workflows and AI-assisted development.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install molcrafts-molpy
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MolCrafts/molpy.git
cd molpy
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## ✨ Features

- **Unified Data Model** — `Frame` / `Block` / `Box` for molecular structures
- **Explicit Topology** — `Atom`, `Bond`, `Angle`, `Dihedral` with typed metadata
- **Force-Field Typing** — rule-based, engine-agnostic typifiers (OPLS-AA, custom SMARTS/SMIRKS)
- **Polymer Builders** — automatic polymer assembly from BigSMILES/GBigSMILES/CGSmiles
  - Linear, branched, and cyclic topologies
  - Polydisperse systems with Schulz-Zimm, Poisson, Uniform, Flory-Schulz distributions
  - Reaction-based crosslinking and network formation
- **Chemistry Parsers** — SMILES, BigSMILES, GBigSMILES, and CGSmiles support
- **Adapter System** — seamless integration with RDKit, LAMMPS, OpenMM, Packmol
- **Reaction Framework** — explicit chemical reactions with leaving groups
- **Lightweight Analysis** — composable compute operators
- **Robust I/O** — PDB, XYZ, LAMMPS DATA, JSON-based formats
- **AI-Friendly APIs** — predictable, strongly typed, minimal magic
